Parameters for procedural camera path generation

Camera positions are generated by adding sinusoidal noise to a linear path
which is tangential to the subject's bounding circle, ie. the minumum circle
constraining the subjects motion in the ground plane. Sinusoidal noise is also
added to the progress along the path, to allow for true parametric motion.

Camera tracking is generated using a look vector, which tracks the subject's
root joint (with smoothing and sinusoidal noise).

Parameters for generation of benchmark dataset
Benchmark dataset is far more constrained than procedural dataset.
For each scene we generate paths which contain pure rotation in a random
direction and pure movement in some direction, maintained for a set time.
